        and visit. The street is line with coffee shops, restaurants with good beer and boutique
        shops. At lunch I would sometimes walk down to the Chittenden Locks, which in my opinion, is
        a must see in Seattle."

        From Montlake Boulevard, we turn left onto Lake Washington Boulevard and make our way to 90
        east. Along the way, this route offers stunning views of Lake Washington, an on a clear day,
        Mt. Rainier."
